# Protobuild Inex

This is the ASP.NET Core application which implements the [Protobuild website](https://protobuild.org) and package index.  It uses Google Cloud Datastore and Google Cloud Storage for storage of packages.

**Note:** This is a rewrite of the original PHP implementation, as Google made breaking changes to their Datastore APIs and it was no longer feasible to update the PHP application to suit.
